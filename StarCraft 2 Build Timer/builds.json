 "Description" :
    "Welcome in this tutorial about playing against a very aggressive terran (in French). After watching this guide, you will know how to play against this kind of player without a lot of micro. The build order that is used id dedicated to Protoss vs terran. This tutorial explain you each step and each reaction that you can use to hold things like : fast banshee, tank marines all-in, scv pull etc. Don't underestimate recall to save units - Play with fast robotic - Be ready for drops - Goal : 3 Colossie then switch to zealots, immortals, archons - Double forge as soon as you counter a big push - If you have not enough mana on High templar when a big attack come : Make some archons - Battery shields is a must have against every all-ins ",

  "Description" : "Homestory Cup continues to be a fresh supply of wonderful replays and build orders. While this guide isn't inspired by a top GSL Korean player, it is someone who maybe you aren't quite familiar with if you don't pay attention to the 2nd tier of foreign players. Hellraiser is a Ukrainian Protoss who has been making a decent splash towards the top of EU recently. While most people would recognize players like ShoWTimE, Harstem, or PtitDrogo as the resident tier 1 EU Protoss, Hellraiser is trailing very close behind them and has been putting up solid results. He's especially been quite strong in PvP including a 2-0 over ShoWTimE in the WCS Austin Challenger groups. He also just barely missed out on making the playoff bracket at HSC in the tough Group C. I also see him and Harstem practicing a lot on Harstem's stream trading games all the time.\nFrom him we get to see, what I guess, is a continuation from last week where we do some more blink disruptor play! With how popular Stargate builds have been lately (seriously, the amount of games I had to go through to not find a Stargate variation was absurd) there has been some blink builds also coming back to try and gain an advantage vs them. This Sentry first version with a few extra Stalkers out helps to do that in the safest way possible. ",

  "Description" : "herO's BACK in Code S and he's already giving us some wonderful fun new builds to try out on the ladder. Despite not making it into Code S last season, he seems to be in good form as he advanced to the Ro16 the other week in stylish fashion. He showed a few interesting new PvZ builds against Solar (poor guy keeps getting innovated on. First Zest now herO) that were a refreshing sight after weeks and months of Stargate into archon drop variations. I'm amazed to say it, but herO legitimately won with a Soul Train in 2018. Not only did he bring back a Soul Train, but he did so in an extremely interesting and intelligent way that revolves around how early game Zerg scouting works in the current meta. While the push is designed to kill (and it should have vs Solar) sometimes it can be held, and herO followed it up with possibly the sexiest choice he could have gone for: Disruptors. So while the transition is not exactly something that should be happening, I suppose I'm continuing the combo of disruptor style BotWs with a rare PvZ edition as well.",

  "Description" : "Pretty straightforward mech build with many details that can improve your play.\nNotes\nHitting a crisp hellbat-cyclone timing is key as that's your first real pressure. I tend to use a non cloak banshee with it as a bit of bonus damage and of course to keep me safe against rushes. However if you prefer 2 banshees and cloak, or a liberator, or even a raven, any of those can work also.\nScan their hive timing and make sure you have 4-8 vikings ready when vipers are out and that you spread your tanks way more at this stage onwards.\nRecycle medivacs from thor drops to elevate hellions/hellbats into the main base. Counter-attack the far out expansions with hellions and the occasional liberator also.\nKey order: 1. Banshee 2. 2 Cyclones 3. +1 weapons 4. 2nd + 3rd factory (swap onto the barracks and starport tech labs) 5. rax and starport swap off and build reactors 6. 2 thors and 2 medivacs 7. 2nd armoury and 4th factory (on rax reactor) 8. 3-4 more factories with tech labs",
